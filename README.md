Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
1Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is the ideation and the building of software programmes that are meant to solve a real world problems using code 
2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first milestone was when the term software engineering was coined by the NATO conference which addressed the issues associated with software engineering implementation at the time thus making it a recognized practiced discipline in the industry,The second milestone was the rise of structured programming which ensured that coded projects  could be broken down into segments thus eliminating (spaghetti code ) at this stage this is when the waterfall model  was introduced. The final milestone which is a result of our current state also known as the Agile revolution and dev ops was a process of the adoption of agile workflow which brought about collaboration as well as iterative development and the rise of dev ops which is the mix of development and operations thus us seeing continuous intergration and continuos development in the life cycle of a software, enabling automation and relatability and fast delivery of software      
3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Planning -this is the why of the project the ideation phase where limiting factors are identified and the shape ,tech stack ,time frame , teams allocated and spints are delibarated and decided on how the execution of the software blue print will be executed 
    Analysis -this is how of the project , when the tech stack has been chosen ,types of individuals needed for the project have been decided , if the team will be using agile or waterfall method , The best strategy is identified 
    Design-The look,feel and usability of the app are now decided 
    Implementation -this is the when , all the plans that were made are now being carried out and production starts 
    Testing and intergration -once the developers are done with the code it is tested to ensure that it is fully functional and if it passes it is pushed to the master branch for shipping 
    Maintenance -once the code is pushed to shipping and is released its time to attend to any future bug reports and updates and patches that are required to make the app better in functionality and security  
4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Scenario 1
this one shall be using the waterfall method in short it is a rigid and linear process which is strict and makes it difficult to add any changes,roles are clearly defined and documentation is heavily detailed , testing is done after development is done and customer feedback and testing is taken when the project is done. this ideal for compliance reliant projects for the government, Bank or the millitary 
Scenario 2 
this one shall be using the agile method it is a flexible and diverse process changes are usually constant as it accommodates those , roles are interchangeable ,testing is done while coding and production is being pushed resulting in them relying on constant customer feedback , constant cycles of sprints are present in this workflow and incremental changes are the order of the day here ,this one is used for majority of the softwares that we use which would be enterprise softwares , e commerce and mobile apps that are not compliance strict 
5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - this is the individual who is tasked with coding and ensuring that the planned software comes to life and does not contain bugs and is fully functional 
Quality Assurance Engineer - they test the Software developer's code base and ensure that there are no errors an that the code is ready to be pushed to shipping 
Project Manager - The person tasked with ensuring that the life cycle of the software goes as planned and everyone is doing what they need to do and is reaching their targets and has to report to the involved stake holders on the progress 
6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - speed up the coding process by providing tools which are extentions or features that autocomplete code , have debugging tools , check errors and highlight syntax which essentially speeds up the development process,creates better quality code and enhances collaboration.An example of an IDE would be VS code which is widely used in the industry 
VCS - this is the inventory of all software development thus keeps track of all code that has been pushed, changed , deleted and give a flexible ability to revert back or track changes and deleted code which essentially enhances collaboration as people can work on the same code base from any part of the world instantly an example of this is git ,github and git lab 
7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. lack of adequate security knowledge which leads creation of vulnerable apps that have a     large surface attack area for hackers this can be mitigated by educating engineers on security best practices 
b. Constant changes to the functionality of an app when its under production can cause massive delays as that requires refactoring of the code base a way to fix this is to ensure that changes are done overtime and not abruptly as well as to ensure that most of the functionality if not all is stated in the planning phase of the software life cycle 
c. Keeping up with the rapid changing technology and frameworks can be quite daunting to curve this challenge one must ensure that they read documentation of new frameworks and take online courses to stay up to date 
d. large remote teams can have communication issues when it comes to large projects thus using plaforms like slack and having stand up meeting every day before the day commences is crucial 
8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - this verifies individual components like functions , methods and classes. helps to fix bugs early in the development phase and ensures the minute mechanics of the app work as expected 
intergration testing - this ensures that different modules and components that have been coded work well the importance of this is that it detects any miscommunication between different modules and ensures that API's , databases and services interact as expected 
system testing -  this checks if the entire app meets the specified requirements and this ensures that the app works as expected and can identify any security vulnerabilities 
acceptance testing -  this is conducted by end users to ensure that the product is ready for deployment  and this reduces post release bugs and ensures system meets customers expectations 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is the conjuring of specific and efficient instructions that will produce the desired result from the A.I the importance of this is to ensure that data stored in the A.I is manipulated efficiently to get a result without using an unnecessary amount of tokens 
2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Promt 1 
generate a sprite ( game character) for a game that  I am making make him look cool 
Promt 2 
generate a sprite that is tall , aged 24 , look dangerous , has short  black hair , has a body builder build , dresses in street style wear and in black in race they are the prontagonist of the game 
explanation the second prompt is more effective because it give the A.I a clear description of the game characters features which minimizes random generation as the A.I has a  distinct path to follow when generating the character thus reducing the amount of prompts to get to the desired result
